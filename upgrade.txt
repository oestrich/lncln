Upgrading from 0.11.0
---------------------

Make sure your site is backed up before attempting an upgrade.

The recommended way to upgrade is to remove everything but the
images folder.  Upload the new version of lncln and apply these
SQL commands:

ALTER TABLE `images` ADD `view` INT( 12 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';

ALTER TABLE `users` ADD `uploadCount` INT( 8 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';

INSERT INTO `betalncln`.`settings` (`id`, `name`, `value`) VALUES (NULL, 'register', '1');

If you have a problem creating the `news` table then please try the forums
for help.
