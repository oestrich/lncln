Upgrading from 0.10.1
---------------------

Make sure your site is backed up before attempting an upgrade.

The recommended way to upgrade is to remove everything but the
images folder.  Upload the new version of lncln and apply these
SQL commands:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `news` (
  `id` int(8) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `postTime` int(32) NOT NULL,
  `title` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `news` text NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ;

ALTER TABLE `news` ADD `title` VARCHAR( 50 ) NOT NULL AFTER `postTime` ; 

If you have a problem creating the `news` table then please try the forums
for help.
